Hi {firstname}!

You have an item checked out via openbare that's going to expire soon.

'{lendable}' is due on '{due_on}'. Unless you renew it or request an
extension, the item will automatically be returned, and we'll clean up any
mess you left.

If you'd like to take some action, you can visit openbare at:
{primary_url}

Have a great day!
